# `Combined Data` Case

Following a crossmatch (or just within a single table), tool authors want to
aggregate various pieces of information into new data points or products.
Examples include:

- Colours or even SEDs from photometry points
- Proper motions or even orbits from positional measurements
- Time series from, say, radial velocity measurements
